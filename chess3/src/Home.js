        <br/> <br/>

        Chess has an endured history of 1400 years. The next 1400 years are even brighter, with the help of web3.

        <h2 className="explanation">Introducing Chess Campaigns</h2>
        <h3 className="text"> Team up with your friends and battle in factions on a real-world map inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte's campaigns. Opposing factions wage war in large-scale tournaments for dynamic territories powered by player driven decision making and strategy.

        <br/> <br/>

        Players capture and defend territories for their faction by battling in matches of chess, winning or losing their team tokens.

        <br/> <br/>

        Pay attention when creating or joining your faction - the faction's country will have its own set of strengths and weaknesses for a diverse gameplay experience.
